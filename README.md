# Svg-Dynamic-directional-Path.js
It is a javascript library. Using this library you can create Dynamic path with arrow direction between html div elements with good visualization and responsive.
# Why need Svg-Dynamic-directional-Path.js??
Sometimes we need to connect two div elements dynamically with direction for best visualization in our application.
# Prerequisites
- Here always path will be ended in top width of div elements.
- Always prefer to take big size(width to be big) div elements. like 100px width of div elements.because for best visualization this library takes some gap between two points which are in  same element.Otherwise its visualization will not be perfect.
- Always take some space around any div otherwise if you take any div element in (0,0) point then either you can not see paths or you visualization will be worst.
